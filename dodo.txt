Wishlist:

- fix youtube strings to truncate extra GET vars, queue erroneously recognizes the same videos as different
- add feature to examine recommended videos from YT and decide whether or not to include them to queue
- add feature to rank queue (perhaps by how many times a video has been recommended by other videos)

Notes:
